Kanban board - Uses MSAL authentication and MS Graph API to retrieve information from logged in users MS Planner account. 

It does not use a compiler such as webpack. 

Can be cloned to apache server, documents folder (On Mac: /library/webserver/documents) and run locally.

Do not forget to #npm install after you have cloned the repo. 

* Please also follow seperate instructions in Server folder.


A Microsoft school or work account is required with access to MS Planner. Any plans/groups/task etc are accessible through this APP. The main reason for me makig this app is to be able to see multiple plans at the same time as the native app only allows access to one at a time.  

You will also nee to register your app in Azure AD and store the reply url for your app (e.g. localhost or your chosen domain).
